SyncConnect
SyncConnect is a corporate communication platform designed to streamline team collaboration and enhance productivity. 
It provides a set of features tailored for corporate use, aiming to facilitate efficient communication and seamless 
collaboration within teams.

Features

Efficient Communication: SyncConnect enables high-quality voice and video calls, allowing team members to communicate 
                         effectively in real-time. Whether it's quick discussions or important meetings, SyncConnect 
                         ensures clear and reliable communication.

Seamless Collaboration: With SyncConnect, team members can easily share their screens during meetings, facilitating 
                        collaboration on projects, presentations, and problem-solving. Real-time collaboration tools 
                        empower teams to work together efficiently from anywhere.

Custom Server Creation: SyncConnect allows administrators to create custom servers tailored to specific departments 
                        or project teams. With role-based permissions, administrators can control access levels, 
                        ensuring that sensitive information remains secure.

Dedicated Meeting Spaces: Each server in SyncConnect includes dedicated meeting rooms where team members can host 
                          discussions, presentations, and brainstorming sessions. These dedicated spaces promote 
                          focused communication and productivity.

Text Channels: In addition to voice and video calls, SyncConnect offers text channels within servers for 
               organized communication. Team members can share updates, files, and important 
               information, keeping everyone on the same page.

User-Friendly Interface: SyncConnect features an intuitive and responsive user interface, making it easy for team 
                         members to navigate the platform and access its features. The user-friendly design 
                         enhances user experience and ensures smooth interaction.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
